    "parts": ["You are the Versatile Leader Assistant, answer questions from \"The Versatile Leader\" written by Msuega Tese on foundational aspects like definitions and concepts of versatile leadership, strategic elements such as being a physician, architect, builder, engineer, and entrepreneur, as well as tactical roles like journalist, coach, parent, judge, pilot, soldier, and diplomat. It emphasizes the importance of adaptability, humility, and seamless collaboration with others to excel in various leadership contexts. Only Answer users questions strictly using this source WHAT IS LEADERSHIP?Joseph Clarence Rost, professor of leadership, analyzed hundreds of leadership definitions offered by authors in the twentieth century. In 1991, he published his findings in a book titled Leadership for the Twenty-First Century. One of his conclusions was that “the dictionary definitions of leadership have been, and continue to be, very simple and, as a result, are not very helpful in understanding the concept.” Furthermore, Rost anticipated that “leadership scholars in the future are going to have to think new thoughts about leadership … critically analyze one another’s theories and models, and engage in dialogic conversations about those conceptual frameworks.”Professor Rost is not the only one who observed the challenges of defining leadership. Professor Robert Steven Kaplan also noted, “If I asked a hundred people to define leadership, I would probably get a hundred different answers.” Please be aware that Kaplan taught leadership at Harvard Business School.However, what is exciting is that Kaplan has defined leadership in a way that makes perfect sense. Consequently, I have ended the many years of my search for a definition of leadership. I vividly remember my first day attending the Harvard Business School leadership class in 2013. Professor Kaplan started his lecture with this statement: “Leadership is figuring out your beliefs and having the guts/ability to act on them in such a way that adds value to others.”I like this way of looking at leadership because it contains three critical components that are very appropriate. First, you want to start by figuring out your beliefs. Beliefs are in the spotlight whenever there is a contemplation of purpose or other vital questions of life. Therefore, clarifying yours is an excellent place to start as a leader. Second, you need to act on those beliefs. Knowing your beliefs is nice, but more is required. You must put them into action to be called a leader. Third, a leader must add value to others. This is where we evaluate leadership. It’s ensuring your actions are producing positive results for others.We can summarize Kaplan’s definition with these three words: beliefs, actions, and benefits.BELIEFSCountries, empires, and even civilizations are built and destroyed on beliefs. In his book Civilization: The West and the Rest, Niall Ferguson, a Scottish historian, argued that the rise of Western civilization is a product of Protestant work ethics. A belief about work, wealth, and education spurred actions that inspired Europe to world dominance for many centuries. Unfortunately, as Europeans have become complacent, they “work less; they also pray less—and believe less.” As a result, their dominance has waned.Even though whole civilizations are created with beliefs, they are deeply personal. Former president of Nigeria Olusegun Obasanjo said, “A man is a slave to his belief[s] because he will unconsciously do everything in his power to conform to them.” Therefore, we need to ensure that what we are conforming our lives to is not causing harm to others but is beneficial to society.Examining one’s beliefs is an exercise not just for the philosopher or the clergy. Every person should attempt to answer fundamental questions, such as “Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?” Interestingly, these three questions are the title of a famous painting found in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts. It is an early twentieth-century work of the French artist Paul Gauguin. The painting contains a beach scene of people, animals, and plants, with the sea and hills in the background.Guinness outlined a four-step approach that helps everyone tackle this crucial quest. The steps are questions, answers, evidence, and commitment. Leadership will be pointless without a sense of purpose. Therefore, I urge every leader to take personal responsibility and address these primary questions head-on. After this, however, you can act confidently.ACTIONSWithout action, beliefs are of no value. James, one of the early church leaders, asked the rhetorical question, “You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?” James further argued that Israel’s ancestors, such as Abraham and Isaac, became faith heroes because of their actions. If we look around us, we will also find many good examples of people who acted on their beliefs for the well-being of others. Sonya Carson is one such example.In 2009, a movie called Gifted Hands told the story of US presidential candidate and neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who would eventually serve as the seventeenth US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The significant part of Carson’s story was the role his mother, Sonya, played in his life. Married at just thirteen years of age, divorced, and only possessing a third-grade education, she didn’t even know how to read. She was a housemaid and lived in abject poverty. Still, she had a simple but essential belief: “Learn to do your best. God will do the rest.”Instead of sitting down, crying, and feeling sorry for herself, she acted on what she believed. She wanted her kids to have a better life, so she reduced their TV time and insisted they go to the library and read. Ben Carson would become an internationally admired figure because her actions gave him a firm foundation. We can learn from Sonya that, regardless of the situation in which a leader finds herself, she must act according to what she believes to be true. For without action, there can be no benefits.BENEFITSWhile it is not wrong to think of the personal gain one can derive from a situation, a leader should always focus on what will be helpful to others. Very often, a leader makes some form of personal sacrifice to enrich the lives of others. This is normal and expected. However, if someone imposes sacrifice on one group so others will reap the benefits, this is no longer leadership—especially if this person is not part of the sacrifice. The old saying goes, “You cannot rob Mario to pay Maria.”A great example of a leader who acted consistently on his beliefs for the benefit of others is the biblical character Joseph. This young man was sold into slavery because he was his father’s favorite. Despite this misfortune, Joseph excelled wherever he found himself.When he worked at the house of an Egyptian official named Potiphar, he did so with diligence. Potiphar’s wife pursued him tirelessly, but he would not flirt with her. Consequently, they locked him up. Even in jail, Joseph was kind and cared for other inmates. Eventually, he became second in command over all of Egypt. If he had strayed from his values, he could have become very corrupt, but he was upright. When he had a chance to repay his brothers, who had been cruel to him, he didn’t. Instead, he said to them, “And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.” Wherever he turned he acted with integrity and helped others, ultimately saving Egypt and surrounding nations from a severe food shortage that lasted for seven years.This is my understanding of authentic leadership. It is consistently acting on your beliefs for the benefit of others. Whether you are at the top or bottom of any organizational chart, your integrity remains a constant. Even if sidelined and mistreated, you can still help others.“The key to all action lies in belief,” according to an English proverb. Therefore, pause and evaluate your beliefs. Then, consider how you can act on them to create excellent outcomes without imposing unacceptable costs on others. That is the mindset of true leaders.CONCEPTSFOLLOWERSWe have already established that leaders act on their beliefs for the benefit of others. Some of these “others” may end up following the leader. However, not everyone will follow you. Also, you should not expect them to do so, regardless of what you have done for them.Since ancient times, many great men and women stood up for what was right, but few people (if any) joined them. For example, ancient prophets such as Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Micaiah were the lone voices of their days. Only from a historical perspective do we value their impact. Can we say these individuals were leaders? I believe they were.Contrast that with social media platforms today that make it possible to have and even buy countless followers. Take Cristiano Ronaldo, a man with over 455 million followers on Instagram. How many would consider him a great leader? Similarly, celebrities like Tiwa Savage, Bruna Tatiana, Virat Kohli, Naomi Watanabe, Huda Kattan, Anne Curtis, and Andy Lau have many followers. Still, some may find it challenging to think of them as true leaders.If we look at our social media platforms, not many people follow us because we are leaders. I follow many people, even companies, to keep myself informed of what is happening. I also have followers, but this says nothing about my ability to lead them. To follow, you click. When you want to stop following, you click again. That’s all. None of this is about leadership.Let’s consider what happened during Jesus’s arrest. Mark reported, “Then everyone deserted him and fled.” So, does it mean Jesus ceased to be a leader because all the followers abandoned him? Well, of course not.To sum up, the widespread perception that a leader must have followers is flawed. Indeed, there are leaders with followers, but we cannot generalize and say it must always be that way.INFLUENCEInfluence is a phenomenon many people use nowadays to define leadership. The word “influence” can be traced back to its medieval Latin root, influentialia, meaning to flow into, visitation, or outbreak. When an outbreak of a disease called “influenza” or “flu” first occurred, unsure how it came about, the Italians called it “influenza di stelle,” meaning influence from the stars. The impact—sickness and death—could be seen and felt, but the cause was superstitious speculation.Also, Merriam-Webster defines influence as “the power or capacity of causing an effect in indirect or intangible ways.” In other words, there is no easy connection between cause and effect regarding influence.If we define leadership as influence, we will need adequate evidence of what we have discovered that those who used the word for the first time did not know. Otherwise, we turn leadership into a mystery. However, leadership is not a mystery. It can be learned, understood, and practiced.Even when leadership results in influence, we can hardly trace which aspect of leadership caused it. Furthermore, we can’t determine in advance what the influence will be. Therefore, it fails to paint an accurate picture when leadership is defined solely as influence.I remember with gratitude Mr. George Varghese, my secondary school mathematics and physics teacher. He was a generous man and offered his students extra lessons for free. At the end of his contract with the school, he stayed several months without a salary to support us till graduation. Many of us in the class benefited from his sacrifice, yet I’m the only one who eventually followed his career path. Though he didn’t choose for me, I could emphasize that Mr. George influenced me. Nevertheless, I remain fully responsible for my decision to study electrical engineering.In some cases, influence does not even happen in one’s lifetime. Take the story of Mohamed Bouazizi. Born in Tunisia, Bouazizi was a street seller who experienced ongoing harassment by the police. On December 17, 2010, he grew so frustrated with the persecution that he covered himself in gasoline and set himself ablaze. An onlooker captured this self-immolation on video and posted it to Facebook. When Bouazizi set himself on fire, few people knew him. However, his action that day sparked the Arab Spring, bringing profound change to the region.In the United States, on May 25, 2020, people were horrified to witness the death of an African American named George Floyd. While few people knew Floyd before this incident, his murder at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer prompted worldwide protests.In the 1960s, meteorologist Edward Lorenz discovered that “small changes in initial conditions can lead to large-scale and unpredictable variation in the future state of the system.” This discovery is called the “butterfly effect.” It is a fitting description of how individuals such as Bouazizi and Floyd have impacted society. Influence functions in the same manner.If we wake up in the morning with a plan to go and influence someone, most likely we will return home disappointed. We can do all the right things, but ultimately the decision to change is not in our hands but theirs. Therefore, trying to predict or control influence is an exercise in futility. This understanding helps me curtail unnecessary stress and disappointments when people do not act as I wish.As I write this book, I pray that it will be helpful to every reader. However, I have no guarantee that it will influence anyone. The results are beyond my control.AUTHORITYI define authority as the right or permission to use power. Authority, for me, is like electricity. Without it, many modern appliances cease to function as intended.Authority is critical to functionality. The crowd identified authority as the distinguishing mark of Jesus’s teachings. See Matthew 7:28–29:Much later, when assigning his followers a crucial task, he knew they would need it, so Jesus gave them authority.It is necessary to point out that even our everyday situations require authority. For instance, when you were a teenager, maybe your parents left the house and asked you to look after your younger siblings. In those few hours that you were in charge, you had authority. If you are an elected representative of your constituency, you oversee their affairs for the period of your mandate. Whether you are a pastor, an elder, or an usher in your church, you have some authority in the house of God.Throughout history, leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela have acknowledged the need for authority before acting. Contrary to some popular views, these men did not act independently. They acted based on the authority given to them. Gandhi was deeply connected to the Natal Indian Congress, an organization he founded in 1894 to fight racial discrimination. Likewise, Mandela joined the African National Congress in 1943 and cofounded its youth league in 1944. These groups provided each man with the authority needed for him to act.As you can see from these examples, leadership requires authority to be effective. However, authority is not a license to oppress others. Instead, we must use it to do valuable work. As former US president and general Dwight D. Eisenhower stated, “You do not lead by hitting people over the head. That’s assault, not leadership.” Or as Kenyans say, “To lead is not to run roughshod over people.”Authority is not a blank check, and it always has limits. So we must make sure we know and respect these limits. A helpful illustration is the famous American boxer Mike Tyson. During his youth, Tyson had over 150 street fights in New York in the 1980s. “By the age of twelve Tyson had been arrested by the police countless times.” His actions violated the authority. However, all of this changed when he transitioned to being a boxer. At the close of his career, Tyson ended with fifty-eight total fights, fifty wins, and only six losses. Known as one of the most dominant fighters of his era, Tyson mercilessly pounded opponents who dared step their foot into the ring.On the streets, Tyson’s actions constituted assault. Conversely, Tyson’s actions were permissible within the roped-off ring, and much of the world paused what they were doing to watch. His actions now had authority. However, when Tyson violated this authority, such as when he bit off a part of Evander Holyfield’s ear, he was penalized.So the question is no longer how to lead without authority. For we now know this is not practical. It is instead how to use the authority we already have to do good repeatedly, irrespective of our position in an organization.POSITIONLeadership is about acting on your beliefs for the benefit of others. Therefore, it is possible to lead from any position. Unfortunately, there is a misconception that only those at the top of an organization can bring about change. Although many chief executives have done great things, you don’t have to be one to make a meaningful contribution.You can also cause change from within the ranks of your company. For example, these days, we know of the company Intel because of its powerful microprocessor chips. However, it wasn’t always that way. Initially, Intel manufactured dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), dominating the market for many years. After stiff competition, Intel changed its core business from manufacturing memory chips to microprocessors. This major shift in Intel’s core business did not start from the top but from the midlevel staff.There is an example of leadership from lower down the organizational ladder. It is the maid to the wife of Naaman, the high-profile Aramean army commander. The Bible says the Aramean king sent Naaman to Samaria at the girl’s advice. He returned home, healed of his leprosy just as the girl had said. It seems the girl did nothing more than make a simple suggestion. Please note that the raiders had forcibly abducted her from her family. Besides, she was their maid, not their family doctor. If things didn’t work out, she could have been in trouble. Despite the risk, she acted on her faith in God and informed them of the prophet. Her advice transformed Naaman’s life for the better. That is leadership, as per our definition in chapter 1.In business, nonexecutive board members, who are not part of the organization’s management, may also initiate change. Most often, they merely advise the executives. Similarly, the wise counsel of a mentor can change someone’s life. That is leadership from the outside. Again, the important thing is not the position.Therefore, irrespective of your position, you can act on your beliefs and achieve remarkable outcomes. You can be a leader; it’s a matter of choice, not position.MANAGEMENTLet us now consider the subject of management. It has the “Latin root manus agere, and it means to act with one’s hands. It follows that managers are people who can give a hand when a job needs doing.”Leadership relates to how we deal with people, whereas management relates to how we deal with things—such as products, systems, and processes. The challenge is to hold both in proper balance. If we go too far on the side of leadership and focus exclusively on people, systems and processes can fall apart. Alternatively, if we devote all our attention to managing things and forget the people behind those things, we end up with a disgruntled workforce.Early in my career, when I worked as an IT support engineer, I had firsthand experience with this point. I enjoyed fixing computer problems. My supervisor, John Gardner, taught me how to write scripts. For many routine tasks, which usually took hours, using scripts, I could complete them with a single command. That was especially exciting. At the end of my first year in this role, I realized that having the end user satisfied was an equally important aspect of my job. I decided then to make a personal goal to give careful attention to my dealings with the end users while ensuring the quality of my work remained high.John left the company, and I became his temporary replacement for about three months. During that time, many team members distanced themselves from me. When I inquired, one of them told me he understood the importance I placed on client satisfaction. However, trampling the employees to do so was not a good idea. Apparently, I was doing just that.That incident taught me that I must consider the needs of all my stakeholders. I also learned that tasks needed to be done and people needed to be attended to at the same time. Another way of saying this is that a leader needs to use both hands—the leader hand and the manager hand.Like most people, you will use your right hand more often if you are right-handed. Similarly, if you are left-handed like me, you usually pick up things with your left hand. In any case, you need both hands in many daily situations, and switching between them happens subconsciously. In the same way, whether you are called a team leader or an operations manager, you will always need both hands. This includes knowing how to lead people and how to manage things.Moving forward, we will take Chris’s point seriously. We will not attempt to separate the two but will keep in mind that leadership and management go hand in hand.SITUATIONAL LEADERSHIPKen Blanchard has made the situational leadership concept famous since the 1960s. The idea is that no single “best” leadership style exists. On the contrary, most successful leaders adapt their leadership style to the prevailing situation. I have found this approach extremely helpful.Critics of this concept think that we can end up with “endless varieties of leadership” and that the executive “looking for a model to help him is hopelessly lost.” As a business executive, I can refute this claim. I do not consider myself to be “hopelessly lost.” Instead, this concept gave me a clear understanding of leadership.It’s not that we need thousands of varieties of leadership. Think of shoe sizes, for example. Even if we add up all the different sizes worldwide, the number might come up to a little more than a hundred. Certainly not thousands or millions. Most stores only carry a limited selection of shoes to serve their customers. Still, despite this limited selection, countless customers frequent these shops every day, and most have little trouble finding a size that fits their needs.We can find another great example in the medical field. No country would think of having an equal number of doctors as they do patients. Instead, one doctor can serve multiple patients in a day and still care for them effectively. Even Sweden, a country credited with the best public health system, has only a little more than five doctors per one thousand people.We don’t need a unique style for every situation. Rather, we can group situations by their common characteristics and apply the relevant leadership styles. That is what situational leadership is all about.We should also consider the chameleon. It varies its skin coloration as a camouflage. For ages, chameleons have gotten a bit of a bad rap. So often, we describe someone who is disingenuous and with questionable character as a chameleon. This unnatural association is very unfair to this gentle and harmless arboreal creature. Like the chameleon, adapting your leadership to the prevailing circumstances is very legitimate. Bill George, the author of Authentic Leadership, wrote, “Good leaders are able to nuance their styles to the demands of the situation, and to know when and how to deploy different styles.”Success will elude us if the situation changes and we don’t adapt our leadership. The Namibians aptly put it this way: “When the rhythm of the drumbeat changes, the dance steps must adapt.”However, adapting to a situation must be done with integrity. Without integrity, adapting is simply manipulating, and that is not situational leadership.METAPHORSTo guard against this, I follow the example of Jesus and explain what aspects or qualities are of particular interest for each metaphor. For instance, we focus mainly on diagnosis, though physicians offer many other important lessons.Some may feel that the lessons we draw from their professions are too narrow. Please remember that this is about leadership, not a textbook in any other domain. Please exercise some patience and read to the end. When you do, I am confident this book will help you become more versatile in your ability to lead.In a nutshell, switching to the appropriate metaphor required by the situation is a critical aspect of versatile leadership.S-CURVEIn 2017, they invited me to give a talk at a forum for young entrepreneurs. So I took the time to reflect on my entrepreneurial journey. I wondered what I would have appreciated if someone had told me at the beginning. That led me to the business life cycle. I also call it the S-Curve because of its shape. It is worth noting that the S-Curve concept became popular due to Richard N. Foster’s book Innovation: The Attacker’s Advantage. However, Foster’s perspective does not limit how I use the S-Curve.As I reflected, I realized that many aspects of business and human life cycles are similar. The stages in the human life cycle move from fetus, baby, child, adolescent, to adulthood and conclude with the elderly. Similarly, there is a start and an end with various stages in between for everything in life.This applies to products, churches, and empires. It may take thousands of years for a nation to decline, but history has taught us that each one that has risen has also fallen. Businesses follow a similar pattern. The stages include preparation, start-up, growth, maturity, and decline (Figure 3.1).Effective leadership requires understanding where your organization is on the S-Curve. In this chapter, we shall look at the characteristics and challenges of each stage. We shall also consider the transitions between them. Dr. Ichak Adizes, the author of Managing Corporate Lifecycles, wrote, “Whenever an organization makes the transition from one life cycle stage to the next, difficulties arise.”STAGE 0: PREPARATIONThe preparation stage is critical but often omitted when describing the business life cycle. It may be the reason many good ideas don’t see the light of day.Therefore, you should take your idea or dream seriously and plan its implementation.In our family, like many others, we celebrate birthdays. Everyone knows that there were about nine months of development preceding the birth of each person. Similarly, adequate preparation should happen before a company opens its doors for business. What pregnancy is to human life, preparation is to a venture.Regardless of how you got into entrepreneurship, please write out your business plan. It will be challenging to convince others that you are serious about your venture if your idea remains in your head.It is not a big deal if you don’t know how to write a business plan. I knew nothing about this process when I decided to establish a company. With very few online sources, I bought books, talked to people, and started writing. Fortunately, these days, countless resources on the internet can serve as a guide for creating a good business plan. Irrespective of which tools you choose, I strongly recommend that you understand basic finance, especially financial statements. There are three primary financial statements: income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow. Understanding these will help you make a financially viable plan. Setting up a business without knowing your numbers is like playing a game of soccer without keeping the score. How will you know if you are winning or losing?Take the time to write out the plan yourself. It will be a mistake to pass this responsibility on to someone else. From experience, writing a business plan helps challenge many assumptions, expose faulty concepts, and bring a great dream to life.The preparation stage ends when you register the venture. Therefore, the registration is akin to a baby being born. A new stage has begun!STAGE 1: START-UPYour venture begins activities at the start-up stage. It would be best if you do not start everything at once. Instead, use the minimum viable product (MVP) concept to test and validate your assumptions. MVP differs from industry to industry and company to company. During Google’s early days, it focused on doing one thing well: offering the best search engine. There were no Google Maps, Google News, or Gmail. They added these services with time.Therefore, if you operate a restaurant, you might start with a few items on your menu and expand from there. That is what MVP is all about. The early start-up is a trial-and-error period, and it requires flexibility. It’s more than implementing your business plan. It’s a matter of being flexible and adaptive to the circumstances. Companies that do this well succeed! For example, David Packard, the cofounder of HP, explained what they did during HP’s initial period:In those early days Bill and I had to be versatile. We had to tackle almost everything ourselves—from inventing and building products to pricing, packaging, and shipping them; from dealing with customers and sales representatives to keeping the books; from writing the ads to sweeping up at the end of the day. Many of the things I learned in this process were invaluable, and not available in business schools.After those early days, David and Bill changed their style for HP to go past the start-up stage. Some entrepreneurs resist this transition to their detriment.Great flexibility is needed when a business has to replace its core product. As mentioned in chapter 2, Intel switched from manufacturing DRAM to microprocessors. Nokia was a pulp mill when it started in the nineteenth century but became the worldwide vendor of mobile phones in the late 1990s. These changes were outside their original business plans, but it was just what each company needed to do to remain in business. Generally, a start-up is more likely to alter its core business than a mature company.The start-up is a difficult stage. The company is new in business, and there is no track record. Getting your first customers on board is a challenging task. We launched Integrated Solutions Angola (ISA), an information technology services company, in 2005. Fortunately, a customer who knew the competence of our founding team members took a chance with us and made cost savings on services. There are other ways also. Some companies offer early adopters free software for a few months. These customers accept to use software that is yet to be thoroughly tested. Thus, creative ways exist to overcome the clients’ initial resistance toward start-ups.Start-ups are generally expensive at the early stage. There is no income, and costs continue to rise. Even when you start making sales, it takes a while before the business reaches a break-even point when its income is just enough to cover its costs. You will have a trough shape if you draw a graph of your net income from when you started spending money during the preparation stage up to the break-even point (see Figure 3.1). Investors call this the “valley of death.” It’s during this period that start-ups fail the most. If making money is your primary motive, this deadly valley will be an impossible challenge. However, with a more meaningful goal, you will probably cross it.Despite their technical expertise, some start-ups fail because their managers lack business and leadership skills.It is difficult to guess how long a company’s start-up stage will last. To depart from this stage, a venture must overcome the valley of death, make regular profits, and demonstrate the potential for reliable growth.STAGE 2: GROWTHThe growth stage brings a time of regular profits combined with more growth opportunities. As desirable as it is, growth has challenges many entrepreneurs often underestimate. Your new hires may not deliver the excellent quality your company is known for, but you don’t have the time to train them. You get new orders, but the bank’s requirements for a credit line are exacting. Relationships deteriorate as different teams act like rival political parties in an election year. The list goes on. These challenges can undermine growth if you don’t address them properly. If the one responsible for the enterprise can’t address these issues, replacement may be a reasonable solution.For example, most people know Steve Jobs as the visionary Apple founder. He was a genius, and his attention to design was unmatched. However, John Sculley made a tremendous contribution to Apple’s early growth. Catherine Clifford wrote, “On April 11, 1983, Sculley joined Apple as the CEO. And from 1983 to 1993, he was the CEO. In that time, Apple went from having revenues of $569 million to $8.3 billion.” Jobs resigned from the company in 1985 and did not return till 1997. While many rightly attribute Apple’s success to Jobs, much of the early growth of Apple happened because of Sculley.The growth stage also requires setting standards, putting systems in place, and continuously improving them to meet the changing requirements. Depending on your industry, you may adopt an existing standard such as ISO 9001:2015. If appropriately implemented, this quality management system allows your company “to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.”STAGE 3: MATURITYStability is a mark of maturity in so many ways. Everyone has come to terms with the expected standard of behavior, and they work together in synergy. The brand is known, and profits are predictable. The systems put in place in earlier stages become stable as the company matures. One example is the Toyota Production System (TPS).Through continuous improvement, Toyota spent decades developing its management system. According to Toyota’s website, TPS is “a production system based on the philosophy of achieving the complete elimination of all waste in pursuit of the most efficient methods.” I like TPS because of its twin pillars, “just-in-time” and “in-station quality.” “Just-in-time” ensures that each process in the chain produces only what the next process requires. Many company cultures punish people for bringing out bad news. In Toyota, the “in-station quality” empowers employees to detect and deal with defects in their stations. No wonder TPS became the precursor to lean management, which nearly all industries now use.Another distinguishing factor of a mature business is its leaders. Supposing a company is around for fifty years, if the founder is required to show up at work daily, it’s not mature yet. Also, if a company loses key staff and struggles, it isn’t mature even if it has been in business for a century. A mature business does not require the presence of any particular person to operate effectively. It has a proper mechanism for the succession of its key people. Anyone can quit or retire, yet the company will continue to thrive. When Bill Gates left Microsoft, the company continued to grow under new leadership. Apple became the most valuable company in the world after Steve Jobs died. That’s how I measure a mature business.Some founders mistakenly enjoy the feeling of being indispensable. They love the sense of dependency everyone has on them, especially since they have been responsible for taking their company through a reasonable period of growth. Please note that serious clients do not trust service providers who depend on specific individuals. Similarly, investors won’t fully buy in if your company has been in business for many years but is unstable.This was something I realized was a problem in my business, and I’ve been working toward less dependence on myself for several years. I wanted a company where I could take a sabbatical leave and eventually retire without fearing it would collapse or stagnate in my absence. We’ve made much progress, but ISA is still not 100 percent there yet.A mature company may have a reasonable period of prosperity with its well-known brand, even without the founder. As time goes on, its leaders may forget its essence. As a result, complacency gives birth to inaction, and arrogance breeds mistakes. Either spoiled child destroys the corporation no matter how long it has existed.STAGE 4: DECLINEOn the S-Curve, the decline comes after maturity. Realistically, a company can nose-dive from any of the preceding stages. When you realize your company is in a downward spiral, your survival instinct may tell you to press the panic button and stop it quickly. However, the more appropriate objective should be to get out of decline quickly and safely. Yes, safety is critical.Consider the boys trapped in a cave in Chiang Rai province in northern Thailand. On June 23, 2018, after a practice session, twelve members of a local football team and their assistant coach entered the Tham Luang Nang Non cave. Unfortunately, they were trapped there due to a flood caused by heavy rainfall. Several experts from different countries carefully planned and successfully executed the special rescue operation. It took nine days before divers were able to contact the boys. Though everyone was eager to get them out, it took another week before the first of the boys was rescued. Three days later, all of them were taken out safely. Overall, some of them had spent seventeen days in the flooded cave!Similarly, your company’s transition into decline may happen without notice, and you may be racing against time like the trapped boys. However, frantic moves are likely to cause more problems. Taking an organization out of decline is also a risky rescue operation that must be done with utmost care.Let’s now look at some factors that may cause a company to decline. The competition comes up with cheaper products. Market conditions change. Or there is a leadership turnover. Companies are highly vulnerable to decline in a volatile world marked by uncertainties and complexities. As happened to Netflix, a wrong decision by its leaders can make any business tumble. Netflix was formed in 1997 and grew steadily for fourteen years. In 2011, Netflix decided to raise the price of its DVD subscription. Within a quarter, it lost over eight hundred thousand customers, representing about 3 percent of its total subscriptions. However, its stock price plummeted by 77 percent! Fortunately, Netflix recovered from this decline by correcting its mistakes. The introduction of “Netflix Original” also helped its upturn.Irrespective of the cause, the main signs of decline are the reduction in revenue and profit margins. Small and medium-sized companies can easily become insolvent due to decline. Large companies may afford to live in decline for some time, but if the ship is not righted, all will sink. For example, Kodak lived in decline for many years but eventually filed for bankruptcy on January 19, 2012.Like the boys, it is possible to take a “trapped” company out of decline safely. IBM declined for several years and eventually, in 1993, posted a USD $8 billion loss—at the time, the biggest in American corporate history. However, that wasn’t the end for the multinational technology corporation. IBM’s recovery from the near-death experience is called corporate turnaround. It is like a start-up overcoming the valley of death and going on to the growth stage. The only difference is that the company is no longer new.Discussion on the decline stage is incomplete without examining corruption. Corruption destroys institutions and nations. Let us consider the airline industry in Africa. I look back to when I began my international travel in the midnineties. During the first decade, I had used the following African airlines: Nigeria Airways, Air Gabon, Air Afrique, Ethiopian Airways, Kenya Airways, and South African Airways. Here are their statuses as of the time of writing. Ethiopian Airways is the only one still operating profitably. Unfortunately, the good news stops there. South African Airways went bankrupt in 2020. It is undergoing recapitalization in an attempt to bring about its turnaround. Kenya Airways has not made a profit for a decade. Yet there is still more bad news.Nigeria Airways, Air Gabon, and Air Afrique have gone extinct. Please note that these airlines were not start-ups when they failed. No, they started operations in the 1950s and early 1960s and operated for several decades before they went bankrupt. Each had provided jobs to thousands of people. It is not clear what caused Air Gabon to fail. However, corruption and mismanagement brought down Nigeria Airways and Air Afrique.Corruption thus threatens the entire society! However, each leader must take personal responsibility. I remember one incident that illustrates my point. I was visiting the US and was in a taxi in New York City. The taxi driver happened to be an African like me. Our discussion quickly drifted to corruption in Africa and its impact on the continent. When we arrived at the destination, he asked if he could write a higher amount on the receipt after I had paid him. I wondered why he would do that. He told me that, as individuals, we couldn’t change anything and that I should try and help myself. I asked him, “How is this different from what we have just complained about?”We shouldn’t diminish the impact an individual can make. This whole thing is like democracy—every single vote counts. A vote for corruption is a vote for destruction. A clear conscience is priceless, even if you may not change the system.In conclusion, the S-Curve shows organizations’ stages: preparation, start-up, growth, maturity, and decline. The metaphors in parts II and III are helpful to leaders as they navigate the challenges of the S-Curve stages and their transitions. Leadership Strategy Metaphors PHYSICIANUnderstanding the S-Curve stages is foundational, but part II explores strategy metaphors that offer valuable insights. The physician metaphor emphasizes the importance of diagnosing an organization's status before strategic planning. Like a doctor's diagnosis, a thorough assessment helps leaders understand their organization's vital signs, utilizing tools like SWOT analysis for internal and external evaluation.Leaders should make their own assessments rather than solely relying on others' diagnoses, ensuring informed decision-making. The physician metaphor proves invaluable during major events like the COVID-19 pandemic, guiding leaders in assessing the situation and crafting appropriate responses.Just as physicians prescribe medication carefully to avoid overdoses, leaders must consider the potential consequences of their actions. The example of Russia's invasion of Ukraine underscores the importance of strategic restraint and thoughtful decision-making to prevent disastrous outcomes.In summary, the physician metaphor aids leaders in diagnosing situations and crafting effective strategic responses, ensuring prudent decision-making in times of uncertainty or crisis.ARCHITECTWhen embarking on new endeavors like starting a company or movement, employ the architect metaphor to craft a clear vision and practical plan for implementation. The architect metaphor emphasizes the importance of translating ideas into tangible outcomes through meticulous planning and oversight.Similar to how architects sketch out a finished project in the studio and oversee construction on-site, leaders should develop a strategic vision and actively supervise its implementation, especially during the early stages. Just as King Pharaoh recognized the value of Joseph's plan to mitigate an impending crisis, leaders must remain flexible during implementation, adapting to unforeseen challenges and changes.To ensure success in uncertain environments, leaders can adopt a co-created vision approach and integrate scenario planning into their strategic processes. This method fosters flexibility and adaptability, crucial for navigating complex and unpredictable situations effectively.Leaders must also avoid pursuing grandiose visions that may result in unfinished projects, akin to the Ajaokuta Steel Mill in Nigeria. Instead, they should focus resources on feasible initiatives with tangible benefits, akin to the Tower of Pisa's gradual corrective measures that transformed a potential failure into a famous landmark.Despite challenges, visionary leaders like Moses, Lee Kuan Yew, and Bill Gates demonstrate the power of clear vision and strategic planning in achieving transformative goals. Therefore, aspiring leaders should embrace the architect metaphor to guide their endeavors and ensure successful outcomes for their organizations.BUILDERSAfter diagnosing a leadership situation with the physician metaphor and confirming a healthy organization with a clear vision, it's crucial not to hastily discard existing systems and processes. Instead, adopt the builder metaphor to understand and execute the vision effectively, as exemplified by John Sculley's tenure at Apple, where he focused on implementing Steve Jobs's vision, leading to significant growth.Builders lay a strong foundation before constructing, recognizing that the foundation determines the structure's strength. Similarly, leaders must value their people, the organization's foundation, treating them with dignity and respect. They should handle employee departures with care, maintaining long-term relationships and considering ex-colleagues as ambassadors.Building with quality is essential for longevity, as demonstrated by the lasting success of organizations like Standard Bank of South Africa and HarperCollins Publishers. Leaders must commit to quality and wisdom in executing existing visions, exemplified by Joshua's leadership in entering the Promised Land and Solomon's construction of the temple.Recognizing the contributions of architects and builders is vital, as evidenced by the teamwork involved in projects like the Burj Khalifa. Leaders should prioritize completing projects over seeking credit, following Indira Gandhi's advice to focus on getting the job done rather than competing for recognition. Reviving abandoned projects presents a niche opportunity for leaders to make a lasting impact.ENGINEERSAs an engineer, I recognize that this isn't an engineering manual but a guide on learning problem-solving from engineers for organizational challenges.Engineers approach problems with curiosity, persistence, and creativity, essential traits for leaders as well. Just as engineers understand how things work before fixing them, leaders must comprehend the issues facing their organizations to propose effective solutions. Election campaigns often focus on candidates' ability to grasp critical issues and provide clear plans for resolution.While the physician metaphor is suitable for diagnosis, the engineer metaphor excels in problem-solving, especially during organizational decline.Problem-solving involves starting with basics, as seen in an engineer's approach to fixing a server issue with a simple cable reconnection. Leaders should remember that not all problems require complex solutions.Persistence is key in problem-solving, turning seemingly impossible goals into reality. Leaders must persevere through challenges, as exemplified by Nelson Mandela's relentless pursuit of ending apartheid in South Africa.Creativity plays a crucial role, ranging from imitation to innovation and invention. While imitation serves as a foundation for creativity, leaders must innovate or invent when imitation isn't feasible or ethical.In conclusion, leaders can learn valuable problem-solving lessons from engineers, adopting curiosity, persistence, and creativity to address challenges and drive continuous improvement in themselves, their organizations, and society.ENTREPRENEURIn \"The Versatile Leader,\" different metaphors guide leaders through various organizational scenarios. The physician metaphor aids in diagnosing organizational issues, the architect metaphor envisions the future, and the engineer metaphor solves problems. Regardless of the situation, the entrepreneur metaphor is crucial for producing tangible results.Entrepreneurs are pivotal in driving economic growth, job creation, and innovation. Leaders can learn valuable lessons from entrepreneurs, such as embracing ownership, optimism, risk-taking, and prioritizing results.Ownership is a mindset that transcends titles or financial stakes. Leaders should take responsibility for achieving organizational goals, even if immediate benefits aren't apparent. Learning from entrepreneurs like Fatima Almeida and Mario Goldinho, who demonstrate deep dedication to their ventures, can inspire leaders to foster a sense of ownership.Optimism, a trait inherent in entrepreneurs, can be learned and cultivated by leaders. Optimistic leaders perceive setbacks as opportunities for growth, just as Nwankwo Kanu turned a career-threatening heart defect into a foundation saving lives. Leaders can practice \"optimistic disputation\" to counter negative thoughts and overcome obstacles.Risk-taking is inherent in entrepreneurship, but successful entrepreneurs carefully manage risks. Analyzing potential outcomes and considering both the positive and negative consequences are crucial steps in decision-making. Balancing risk appetite with risk capacity is essential to avoid catastrophic outcomes.Ultimately, entrepreneurs pursue results that matter. While profit is vital for sustaining a business, visionary leaders also prioritize broader ideals like social justice and honesty. Engaging stakeholders in meaningful leadership ideals fosters alignment and inspires collective action toward shared goals.In summary, leaders can benefit from adopting the entrepreneurial mindset to drive meaningful results, navigate challenges, and inspire positive change within their organizations and communities. Leadership Tactics Metaphors JOURNALISTIn Part III of \"The Versatile Leader,\" we explore metaphors for tactics, essential for daily operations and reliant on defined objectives for efficacy. Just as the physician metaphor aids in strategic diagnosis, the journalist metaphor serves tactics by obtaining day-to-day information, emphasizing the need for truthful assessments.Journalists excel at obtaining reliable information firsthand, emphasizing the importance of proximity to events for accuracy. Similarly, leaders must seek primary sources to ensure the integrity of their decision-making. Strategies like Management by Walking Around (MBWA) and Gemba encourage leaders to engage directly with their teams and operations to gather firsthand insights.In today's virtual work environment, leaders must adapt to obtain information effectively. Social media platforms offer valuable sources of real-time information, akin to an extended form of “management by walking around (MBWA)”. However, leaders must navigate privacy concerns and interpret digital cues accurately.Once leaders have gathered information, effective reporting is essential. Leaders can learn from journalists how to communicate findings clearly and confidently, ensuring stakeholders understand decisions and actions. Like journalists, leaders should tailor their communication to their audience, avoiding technical jargon that may hinder understanding.Furthermore, leaders can adopt strategies from journalism, such as press briefings and breaking news updates, to disseminate information efficiently. By promptly sharing relevant updates with stakeholders, leaders maintain transparency and build trust.However, leaders must also be wary of misinformation, as falsehoods erode credibility and trust. Honesty remains paramount, even in challenging situations, as credibility is essential for effective leadership.In summary, leaders can leverage tactics inspired by journalism to gather reliable information, communicate effectively, and maintain trust with stakeholders. By adopting these strategies, leaders can navigate daily operations with clarity and integrity, driving meaningful outcomes for their organizations.COACHThe journalist metaphor sheds light on organizational dynamics, yet the challenge lies in effectively utilizing gathered insights. In the upcoming chapters, we explore metaphors aiding confident leadership across various internal scenarios. The first metaphor, the coach, imparts valuable lessons on team selection, training, delegation, time management, and sportsmanship.1.     Selection: Just as coaches meticulously select players, leaders must carefully choose team members, prioritizing character over competence. Paul Ubwa's hiring experience emphasizes the significance of virtue and attitude in potential candidates.2.     Training: Coaching involves patient, tailored instruction. Similarly, leaders must train individuals to understand fundamentals while allowing room for unique approaches and creativity. Notably, coaching isn't about cloning; it's about nurturing individual talents.3.     Delegation: Effective delegation, akin to a coach trusting players on the field, transfers responsibility without blame shifting. Jethro's counsel to Moses highlights the importance of observing before advising, with varying levels of delegation based on team members' competencies.4.     Time Management: Coaches excel at timing changes for maximum impact, a lesson applicable to leaders. Whether in sports or business, every second counts, emphasizing the need for efficient time management to achieve remarkable results.5.     Sportsmanship: Just as there's a clear winner in every competition, leaders must embrace sportsmanship, exhibiting grace in victory and defeat. Accepting responsibility, as exemplified by Luiz Felipe Scolari after Brazil's defeat, fosters a culture of growth and accountability within organizations.In summary, the coach metaphor provides invaluable insights for leaders striving to cultivate effective teams, manage time efficiently, and uphold integrity and sportsmanship in their organizations.PARENTParenting offers a poignant metaphor for leaders aiming to establish a lasting legacy. Emotions play a crucial role in both realms, influencing outcomes significantly. Leaders can draw inspiration from emotional intelligence in parenting, ensuring positive responses to a spectrum of emotions, from fear to happiness.1.     Emotional Intelligence: Just as good parents navigate emotional complexities, leaders must manage emotions effectively in the workplace. Emotional intelligence fosters successful outcomes, emphasizing empathy and understanding.2.     Boundaries: Like parents setting limits for their children, leaders establish boundaries to maintain order and productivity. Clear guidelines prevent chaos and promote responsible behavior among team members.3.     Continuity: Similar to the generational cycle in families, leaders cultivate succession plans to ensure organizational longevity. Fostering a culture of mentorship and development enables seamless transitions and sustained effectiveness.4.     Legacy: Leaders contemplate their legacy, understanding that actions speak louder than words. Just as individuals leave footprints in the sand, leaders leave lasting impressions through their daily decisions and interactions. Building a legacy involves impacting others positively, leaving a meaningful imprint on the organization and beyond.In essence, leadership, akin to parenting, involves emotional intelligence, setting boundaries, fostering continuity, and crafting a legacy that endures beyond one's tenure. By embracing these principles, leaders can nurture thriving organizations and leave behind a lasting impact.JUDGEDisclaimer: I am not a legal expert, and this chapter does not constitute legal advice. Instead, it explores using the metaphor of a judge for conflict resolution within a team, administering rewards and penalties, and making ethical decisions.Framework: Understanding the legal framework of your location is crucial. Ignorance of the law is not an excuse for breaking it. Educating yourself about relevant statutes and policies helps avoid legal issues.Golden Rule: Simplify corporate policies like the late Samuel Milton Jones, who upheld the Golden Rule. Treating others as you wish to be treated can guide fair leadership decisions, even without extensive legal knowledge.Precedent: Consider legal precedents or best practices cautiously, ensuring they align with your organization's unique context. Be mindful that decisions set precedents for future actions, impacting organizational culture.Truth: Commit to truthfulness, as lies undermine justice and trust within an organization. Leaders must prioritize honesty and accountability, setting a standard for integrity.Fairness: Base judgments on relevant statutes, precedents, and truthfulness. Presume innocence, gather evidence thoroughly, and avoid punishing the innocent. Fairness in leadership mirrors judicial principles, promoting trust and cohesion.Appeal: Establish a fair appeals process for resolving disputes or correcting errors in judgments. Just as legal systems allow for appeals, organizational leaders should provide avenues for reconsideration when necessary.  PILOTThe previous three chapters have examined metaphors that deal with the internal problems that leaders face, even when there is no doubt about their authority. The metaphors used were coach, parent, and judge. The following chapters will aid in situations where a leader may not have adequate control or authority. Using pilot, soldier, and diplomat metaphors to address such external challenges may bring outstanding outcomes.In this chapter, we will cover the pilot metaphor. You may recall that we humans, with two legs and two hands, shouldn’t be able to fly. But for the envy of birds, we created airplanes that enable us to fly. Also, we keep pushing the boundaries from the Wright brothers’ Kitty Hawk, or Wright Flyer, to Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. Consequently, hundreds of people with tons of goods can safely fly nonstop in one jumbo plane across continents. Moreover, through continuous improvement of engineering and procedures, now flying is safer than traveling by motorcycle, car, or train. Are there things leaders can learn from pilots? Yes, absolutely. For instance, most airplane accidents happen during takeoffs and landings. Similarly, more corporate bankruptcies occur during the start-up and decline stages of their life cycle. By choosing to learn from pilots, leaders can improve the safety records of their ventures. Meaning, we can reduce corporate bankruptcies to the barest minimum if we decide to use the pilot metaphor. This chapter will teach critical lessons to prepare for and handle emergencies effectively. I am confident that doing so will make the “flying experience” pleasurable for everyone in your organization.Certification: Pilots undergo rigorous training and certification processes, contributing to the aviation industry's outstanding safety record. Similarly, structured training boosts employee confidence, productivity, and customer satisfaction in various industries.Black Box: Lessons learned from accidents and disasters are crucial for preventing reoccurrence. Organizations should implement robust data protection measures and focus on business continuity to mitigate risks effectively.Emergency Landing: Captain Sullenberger's \"Miracle on the Hudson\" demonstrates the importance of rigorous training and preparation for emergencies. Leaders must prepare for unexpected challenges, recognizing that actions alone may not always suffice, and prayer or seeking higher guidance can provide crucial support.In essence, the pilot metaphor emphasizes the necessity of preparation, training, and readiness to handle unforeseen circumstances effectively.SOLDIERTragedies of war have plagued humanity throughout history, with only fleeting periods of peace since World War II. Nations maintain defense departments and alliances like NATO to safeguard against external threats, employing soldiers across various domains of conflict.Discipline: Soldiers exemplify discipline, adhering to rigorous standards even in seemingly trivial matters like courtesy and cleanliness. Admiral William McRaven's advice, \"If you want to change the world, start by making your bed,\" underscores the importance of discipline in saving lives and minimizing errors.Courage: Courage, rooted in a sense of purpose, empowers individuals to confront fears and tackle challenges. Ejiro Otarigho's heroic act of driving a burning tanker away from populated areas showcases courage driven by concern for others, a quality essential for leaders facing difficult decisions.Loyalty: Loyalty, a cornerstone of military and corporate environments, fosters stability and commitment. Brigadier General Marshall highlights loyalty as the greatest asset in battle, emphasizing its importance in fostering trust and cohesion within organizations.While soldiers embody discipline, courage, and loyalty, leaders must apply these qualities judiciously, fostering a culture of mutual respect and open communication. Thus, the soldier metaphor equips leaders with the fortitude to navigate challenging situations while upholding principles of discipline, courage, and loyalty.DIPLOMATThe diplomat metaphor, although the last discussed, is now regarded as the most crucial in my leadership journey. Growing up in Nigeria's Tiv tribe, where directness was valued, I initially struggled with diplomacy. However, compiling leadership metaphors led me to appreciate diplomacy's importance, especially in navigating sensitive situations.Negotiation: Diplomats excel in negotiation, as demonstrated in resolving conflicts like the Bakassi dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon. Successful negotiations save lives and prevent wars, emphasizing the significance of engaging all stakeholders in reaching binding agreements.Feedback: Diplomacy is essential in giving and receiving feedback constructively. Diplomats consider others' feelings and interests, ensuring that feedback is delivered tactfully to foster growth and maintain relationships. Humility and wisdom are vital in both soliciting and accepting feedback.Tact: Sensitive situations demand tact and wisdom. Diplomats skillfully navigate delicate conversations, avoiding anger and flattery. Jesus's response to the Pharisees' trap exemplifies diplomatic wisdom, emphasizing the importance of responding with wisdom and grace.Hot Mic: Leaders must be mindful of their words, both public and private, to avoid embarrassing situations like the \"hot mic\" blunder. Guarding the heart ensures consistency between private and public discourse, maintaining integrity and trust.In conclusion, the diplomat metaphor equips leaders with essential skills for managing diverse relationships and situations. Embracing diplomacy enhances negotiation, feedback delivery, tactfulness, and integrity, fostering effective leadership in various contexts.SYNERGIZEThe leadership metaphors explored in earlier chapters have provided insights into my strengths and weaknesses, as well as those of others around me. While some metaphors resonate with me naturally, others pose challenges in implementation. For instance, I find strength in architect and engineer metaphors but struggle with the role of a builder and diplomat.Through surveys conducted during my leadership seminars, I've realized that everyone has their areas of strength and weakness. Despite these limitations, many leaders have achieved remarkable feats by collaborating with others both within and outside their organizations. In today's interconnected world, cooperation is no longer optional but essential for success.Adaptability: Adaptability is crucial for teams facing challenges. It involves members altering their roles flexibly to address specific issues, often requiring a shared understanding among team members. The ability to adapt ensures survival, as demonstrated by instances in my own company where employees stepped up to address unexpected situations regardless of their job titles.Collaboration: Leading without formal authority presents challenges in getting others to collaborate willingly. Building consensus is vital, requiring patience and persuasion skills akin to those of diplomats. Collaboration extends beyond local leadership to the global scale, facilitated by the internet and social media through phenomena like crowdsourcing.Crowdsourcing: Crowdsourcing leverages the collective wisdom and resources of a diverse online community to contribute to projects or causes. Platforms like Wikipedia exemplify successful crowdsourcing initiatives, highlighting the importance of vision, transparency, and engagement in mobilizing contributors towards a common goal.Humility: Humility is essential for effective leadership, as it fosters a receptive attitude towards feedback and acknowledges the contributions of others. Pride, on the other hand, can lead to destructive outcomes and hinder personal and organizational growth. Recognizing the supremacy of a higher power and being grateful for the contributions of others are key aspects of humility in leadership.In conclusion, successful leadership requires a balance of adaptability, collaboration, and humility. Embracing these traits enables leaders to navigate challenges effectively, mobilize resources, and foster an environment conducive to growth and innovation.STARTAt this point, I will assume that you have read the earlier chapters and have gained a good understanding of the core ideas presented. Nevertheless, let me restate my main point here. A versatile leader is a person of integrity who, with others, creates valued outcomes using appropriate metaphors. You don’t have to be a superhero to become a versatile leader. You simply need to make up your mind and then start.I suggest you kick off your journey using the journalist metaphor to identify the urgent things. Then use the physician metaphor to gain insight into the strategic status. These two metaphors will expedite your onboarding process. The actions you take after you have found out about the existing situation are equally important. The flowchart in Figure 17.1 will guide you during the early stages of implementing the lessons from The Versatile Leader.STOP THE BLEEDINGWhen you get into a new situation, please use the journalist metaphor to find out if there is any urgent matter at hand. I encountered such a problem on my first day at work in Port-Gentil, Gabon, in September 1997. We had just started with the handover when I saw a fax message from our main client threatening to terminate our service contract. I asked my colleague about the situation. He said, “It’s a normal complaint of a client.” Not seeing anything normal about it, I immediately made that issue my priority. I studied the contract terms, the length of time the problem had been pending, and the previous attempts at solving it. Then, I took the necessary steps and fixed the six-month-old problem during my first week there.Just like emergency workers who arrive at the scene of an accident, the new leader should do what is necessary to stop the bleeding. Reflecting on his early days as the new CEO of IBM, Louis Gerstner said, “We’d stopped the bleeding, reversed the breakup plan, and clarified IBM’s basic mission. The holes in the hull had been patched. This ship was not going to sink.”Therefore, when you get into a new position, you need to find out if there is a pressing issue that cannot wait. Then, please work with the relevant stakeholders and address it immediately. However, if there is no urgent problem, do not invent one. Don’t dent your credibility and derail your onboarding process with pseudoemergencies.Also, no matter what you meet upon arrival, I caution you not to make changes too hastily. Starting in a new position and implementing the wrong changes will ruin trust. Moreover, two stable states are involved in a change—the initial and final states. If you don’t understand the prevailing condition, your change will likely end in disarray.Suppose you have been part of the organization already. In that case, you may know many things at the beginning of your new assignment. In this case, you can hit the ground running, like Joshua. As the Bible indicates, Joshua had been working with Moses for decades. Moses was also meticulous and left a clear plan before he died. Joshua’s first speech as the new leader of the nation of Israel contained instructions to his assistants: “Go through the camp and tell the people, ‘Get your provisions ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the Lord your God is giving you for your own.’”After hearing this, the nation willingly followed Joshua’s instructions and crossed the River Jordan to the other side!Even if you can issue orders like Joshua, you must be careful. Avoid what happened to Executive Order 13769, issued by Donald Trump during his early days as the president of the United States. The “Trump travel ban,” as it’s commonly called, faced many protests, was blocked by the courts, and had to be replaced.Therefore, you should diagnose before making any significant decisions.DIAGNOSEUsing the physician metaphor to diagnose your new organization would be necessary. Before even taking vital signs, doctors ascertain some basic facts, such as the age and sex of the patient. In the same way, a leader needs to know their new organization’s place on the S-Curve (see chapter 3) and its industry. For example, an oil and gas exploration venture may take several years before reaching a break-even point. In contrast, a consulting firm may achieve it in months. So understanding the nature of the business and its industry is essential to your diagnosis.How long will it take to complete the initial diagnosis? It depends on several factors: first, the stage of the organization on the S-Curve; second, the complexity of the situation; and third, what you already know before your first day in the new position.Suppose you are appointed to create an organization from scratch, like Joseph in Egypt. In that case, your starting point is at the very beginning of the S-Curve. The only thing existing before your involvement is a dream or an idea that may not even be yours. Yet you have the responsibility to bring it to reality. Please find out what resources you have initially, the extent of your authority, the expected outcome, and the timeline required to deliver. Once you’ve grasped your new organization well, the architect will be your primary metaphor to drive your leadership strategy. Use it to make plans suitable to the preparation stage we covered in chapter 3.If it is an existing organization, you need to find out how long it has existed. If you realize it is still new, it is most likely a start-up. Start-ups usually lack structure, yet they can do without it initially. Don’t expect a positive net income at an early stage of a start-up. The founder, investors, or loans are the sources of cash for most start-ups. A healthy start-up clearly understands the problem it is trying to solve and has a vision for the future. It also understands the market’s willingness to adopt its offerings. It will be necessary to obtain all the information from various stakeholders as early as possible.That brings us to an important question: How do you know if your organization is in a growth stage? An organization in a growth stage has already passed the break-even point. There is a demand for its products. The vision is understood and implemented. Yet the structure, processes, and procedures are weak or nonexistent. Once your diagnosis shows the growth stage, you will need the builder metaphor to take the organization to its full potential. As explained in chapter 6, builders need to understand the vision, history, and success factors. Then they need to work hard to take it to the next level.If you build well, your company will eventually reach maturity. A builder may still do well at the early stage of maturity. However, the result may not be the same as during the growth stage. Over time, the growth rate will slow down.A mature organization is the hardest to change. Therefore, when you enter a mature organization, you must be careful about how you go about your preconceived plans. Tactically, the diplomat metaphor should be your daily companion. Strategically, you will need a combination of builder and engineer metaphors.Suppose you join the company when it is obviously in decline. Where should you start? First, you still need the physician metaphor to find out if this is true and what is the likely cause of the decline. Then, once you have confirmed the company’s status, you will need the engineer metaphor to guide your turnaround strategy.As you can see in Figure 17.1, no matter the state of the organization or the metaphor you use as your initial strategy, you must deliver results. For that, you need the entrepreneur metaphor. Please create KPIs, which you will use to track your progress.In your new role, there are things you will like naturally and others that will be a struggle. Please delegate if you have capable hands around you. If, for any reason, you can’t delegate, then you need to act like an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs want results to the extent that they are willing to take on any role, even if they don’t find it pleasant. Furthermore, your ability to work seamlessly with others will be required for you to deliver good results. Assuming familiarity with earlier chapters, the main point reiterated is the essence of a versatile leader, characterized by integrity and the adept use of appropriate metaphors. You need not possess superhuman abilities; rather, a determined start is key.Address Urgent Issues: Upon entering a new role, akin to emergency responders at an accident scene, swiftly identify and resolve pressing matters using the journalist metaphor. This prevents credibility damage and lays a stable foundation for future endeavors. However, avoid manufacturing crises needlessly.Exercise Caution in Change: Resist hasty alterations upon arrival, as premature changes can erode trust and destabilize the organization. Diagnose the situation thoroughly, leveraging the physician metaphor, to comprehend the organization's stage on the S-Curve and industry dynamics.Adapt to Organization Stage: Tailor your approach based on the organization's developmental stage. For startups, focus on vision and market alignment; growth stages require building infrastructure for scalability; mature organizations demand diplomatic finesse; declining entities necessitate engineering-driven turnaround strategies.Entrepreneurial Mindset: Irrespective of challenges, adopt an entrepreneurial mindset, setting measurable KPIs to track progress. Delegate tasks where feasible, or assume diverse roles to drive results effectively, emphasizing seamless collaboration with team members.In summary, effective leadership hinges on adaptability, diagnostic precision, and entrepreneurial vigor, underscored by collaboration and humility. Utilizing appropriate metaphors empowers leaders to navigate complexities and drive meaningful outcomes in diverse organizational contexts."]

They are not required to be superheroes but need to make up their mind and start their leadership journey. Versatile leaders can adapt their leadership styles to different situations, similar to how a chameleon changes its skin color. Adapting to situations with integrity is a key aspect of versatile leadership. The ability to switch to the appropriate metaphor required by the situation is also highlighted as a critical aspect of versatile leadership."]

    "parts": ["In the context of leadership, the physician metaphor represents the importance of making a diagnosis before taking action. Just like a good doctor starts with a diagnosis before prescribing treatment, leaders should assess the real status of their organization or situation before making strategic decisions. The physician metaphor emphasizes the need for leaders to gather information, analyze it, and understand the situation thoroughly before leading effectively. \n\nThe physician metaphor is used to describe certain leadership styles or behaviors by highlighting the following points: \n\n**1. Diagnosis Before Action:** Leaders should not rush into decisions but should take the time to diagnose the situation properly. \n\n**2. Assessment and Analysis:** Just like doctors conduct tests and examinations to understand a patient's condition, leaders should gather information and analyze it to make informed decisions. \n\n**3. Avoiding Malpractice:** The metaphor emphasizes that making decisions without proper diagnosis can be detrimental, similar to how prescribing treatment without understanding the root cause of an illness can be harmful. \n\n**4. Adapting to New Situations:** When leaders find themselves in new situations or facing major events, they should follow the physician metaphor by diagnosing the situation first. \n\nBy using the physician metaphor in leadership, individuals are encouraged to approach challenges methodically, prioritize understanding over immediate action, and ensure that decisions are based on a thorough assessment of the circumstances."]

Engineers are problem solvers who improve on what already works with curiosity, persistence, and creativity. They understand how things work and are essential for turning around organizations facing significant issues. Therefore, in a situation where a company is in decline and needs a strategy to guide its turnaround, the engineer metaphor is recommended for solving the problems and leading the organization back to success."]

Here are some steps you can take: \n\n**1. Diagnosis with the Physician Metaphor:** Start by diagnosing the organization's issues using the physician metaphor. Understand the root causes of the decline before proceeding. \n\n**2. Problem-Solving Approach:** Once you have identified the problems, apply the engineer metaphor to solve them systematically. Learn from engineers who start with the basics of how things work when faced with challenges. \n\n**3. Mindset Shift:** Embrace the mindset of an engineer when tackling problems. See challenges as opportunities for improvement rather than obstacles. Keep trying different solutions until you find what works. \n\n**4. Collaboration and Delegation:** Work seamlessly with others in the organization. Delegate tasks to capable team members if possible. If delegation is not an option, be willing to take on any role necessary to drive results, just like an entrepreneur. \n\n**5. Continuous Improvement:** Implement a culture of continuous improvement within the organization. Encourage learning and development among your team members to enhance problem-solving skills and creativity. \n\nRemember, as a leader using the engineer metaphor, your goal is to understand how things work, identify areas for improvement, and implement effective solutions to steer the organization back to success."]

      "role": "model",
      "parts": ["In the context of leadership, influence is defined as the power or capacity to cause an effect in indirect or intangible ways. It is a phenomenon often used to define leadership. Influence can be seen as a form of impact that may not have a direct cause and effect relationship, making it challenging to trace back to specific leadership actions. \n\nThe impact of influence on the success of an organization can be significant. Leaders who possess influence can inspire, motivate, and guide their teams towards achieving common goals. They can shape organizational culture, drive change, and foster innovation. However, it is important to note that influence does not guarantee success, as the outcomes of influence are often unpredictable and may not always align with the leader's intentions. \n\nSuccessful leaders understand that influence is just one aspect of effective leadership. They balance influence with other leadership qualities such as vision, communication, decision-making, and relationship-building to create a positive impact on their organizations. By leveraging their influence effectively, leaders can drive organizational growth, enhance employee engagement, and achieve long-term success. \n\nUltimately, while influence plays a crucial role in leadership, it is essential for leaders to combine it with other leadership skills to maximize its impact on the success of an organization.\n\nInfluence in leadership is highlighted through various examples in the book: \n\n**1. Example of Mr. George Varghese:** The book mentions Mr. George Varghese, a generous teacher who offered free extra lessons to students and supported them even without a salary. While many students benefited from his sacrifice, only one student followed his career path. This illustrates how Mr. George's influence impacted the decision of one student to study electrical engineering. \n\n**2. Example of Mohamed Bouazizi: The story of Mohamed Bouazizi, a street seller who set himself on fire in Tunisia, sparked the Arab Spring, leading to significant changes in the region. Despite few people knowing him before his actions, Bouazizi's influence had a profound impact on society. \n\n**1. Example of George Floyd:** The book mentions George Floyd, whose death at the hands of a police officer led to worldwide protests, showcasing how an individual's actions can influence societal movements. \n\nThese examples demonstrate how influence in leadership can have far-reaching effects, even beyond one's lifetime, and how it can shape individuals and societies in significant ways."]
